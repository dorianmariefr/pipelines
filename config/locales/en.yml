      step_1: First you will need to log in or register.
      step_2: You can register with Google, Facebook, email or phone number.
      step_3:
        If you used email or phone number you will need to verify those, otherwise
        you can create a new pipeline.
      step_4: A pipeline has a name, is it public?, sources and destinations.
      step_5:
        You can include Code in your filter like "score > 100", "keywords.include?("Ruby")"
        or "title.include?("Show HN")".
      step_6:
        A pipeline is processed every minute and you can decide when you will
        receive the emails (now, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) at a specific hour
        in your time zone to the email address of your choice.
      step_7: Now that your pipeline is created you can go ahead and process it.
      step_8:
        You can now see it has been processed and will continue to be processed
        automatically from now on. If any items matched, you will see them at the
        bottom.
